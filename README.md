# Deterministic-nonperiodic-flow

Shout out to **[3Blue1Brown](https://github.com/3b1b)** for making this amazing tool!  
This project visualizes a **deterministic nonperiodic flow**, inspired by **Edward Lorenz’s chaotic systems** and the concept of **deterministic chaos**.  
It is implemented using [**Manim**](https://github.com/3b1b/manim), the mathematical animation engine developed by **3Blue1Brown**.
